# CalculatorApp

The console application demonstrates the calculator functionality. The application takes a single string of input (numbers and operators) and displays the result. The calculation logic exists in two classes: Calculator and Equation. The Calculator class has the method (Calculate) defined to take a string of input and return the result with an error code, if any. The input validation is handled in the Calculator class. The Equation class is used to parse the user input and solve the equation in the order of precedence.
